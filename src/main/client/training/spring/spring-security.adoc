== Introduction

https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/index.html[Spring Security] provides comprehensive support for authentication, authorization, and protection against https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/features/exploits/index.html[common exploits].

The security is a complex subject. We retrieve this complexity in Spring Security

But Spring Security and Spring Boot come with an abstraction to make easier the integration with the main tools and concepts : SSO, OpenID, Oauth, NTLM, LDAP, Kerberos


== Authentication

Authentication is how we verify the identity of who is trying to access a particular resource.

[.text-center]
image:../../img/training/spring-security/authentication.png[width=800]

A common way to authenticate users is to force them to enter a username and password. If user is unknown, app will return a 401 error (Bad authentication)


== Authorization

Once authentication is performed we know the identity and can perform authorization.

[.text-center]

If user has no access to a resource, he will receive a 403 error (Forbidden)


== How to install ?

You can use the Spring Boot starters (one for the main libs and one for tests)

[source,java]
----
implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security")
testImplementation("org.springframework.security:spring-security-test")
----

With nothing else, Spring Security will add a basic auth to your application and you can configure the default user in `application.properties`

----
spring.security.user.name=user
spring.security.user.password=password
----

Spring generate this page for you

You can logout when you try to call
http://localhost:8080/logout


== icon:flask[] : Security level 1

Update your project to be able to secure you app with the default security form (follow the given steps above)


== How it works ?

On a Spring web application, Spring Security support is based on Servlet Filters, so it is helpful to look at the role of Filters generally first.


=== Web filter

When a request is sent to call a controller, the HTTP request is sent to chain of filters which contains the Filters and the Servlet that should process the HttpServletRequest based on the path of the request URI.

[.text-center]
image:../../img/training/spring-security/filter.png[width=900]

In a Spring MVC application the Servlet is an instance of DispatcherServlet. The servlet can handle a single HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse.

Filters can read the request and stop the filter chain if we have a problem and the filter can also update the response

[source,java]
----
public void doFilter(
        ServletRequest request,
        ServletResponse response,
        FilterChain chain) {
	// do something before the rest of the application
    chain.doFilter(request, response); // invoke the rest of the application
    // do something after the rest of the application
}
----

Filters can be activated only on a given path URI and you can add different filter chain depending on this path

[.text-center]

And Spring filter will throw an exception if user is not authenticated or if he has no right to access to a resource

=== Architecture

The security context is hold by a SecurityContextHolder. This object uses a ThreadLocal to store its data (one value by user thread)

[.text-center]
image:../../img/training/spring-security/architecture.png[width=500]

`SecurityContext` contains an `Authentication` object.

An `Authentication` represents the currently authenticated user.

- `principal` contains the details (often an instance of UserDetails)
- `credentials` contains the password or the token
- `authorities` contains the user permissions. These permissions are usually loaded by a UserDetailsService.

An `Authentication` request is processed by an AuthenticationProvider. You can have different  providers in you app. For example,

[.text-center]
image:../../img/training/spring-security/architecture2.png[width=700]

DaoAuthenticationProvider supports username/password based authentication while JwtAuthenticationProvider supports authenticating a JWT token.


== Configuration

We can configure our own `UserDetailsService` to manage the user and their permissions. In this basic example we will use a in memory configuration

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class SpringSecurityConfig {

    private static final String ROLE_USER = "USER";

    @Bean
    public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
        // We create a password encoder
        PasswordEncoder encoder = PasswordEncoderFactories.createDelegatingPasswordEncoder();
        InMemoryUserDetailsManager manager = new InMemoryUserDetailsManager();
        manager.createUser(
                User.withUsername("user").password(encoder.encode("myPassword")).roles(ROLE_USER).build()
        );
        return manager;
    }
}
----

You can add a `SecurityFilterChain` to secure an http route. The default configuration in Spring Boot is this one

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    return http
        .authorizeRequests(authorize -> authorize.anyRequest().authenticated()) // (1)
        .formLogin(withDefaults()) // (2)
        .httpBasic(withDefaults()) // (3)
        .build();
}.httpBasic(withDefaults())
----

<1> Ensures that any request to our application requires the user to be authenticated
<2> Allows users to authenticate with form based login
<3> Allows users to authenticate with HTTP Basic authentication

<<<

But you can use several `SecurityFilterChain` to implement different security level. You can add another filter to only let admin user access to the route `/api/**`

[source, java]
----
@Bean
@Order(1) // (1)
public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    return http
        .antMatcher("/api/**") // (2)
        .authorizeRequests(authorize -> authorize.anyRequest().hasRole("ADMIN")) // (3)
        .formLogin(withDefaults())
        .httpBasic(withDefaults())
        .build();
}
----
<1> If you have more than one filter you need to use an annotation `Order` to define the first one to use
<2> antMatcher states that this HttpSecurity will only be applicable to URLs that start with `/api/`
<3> we can specify the roles that will really have access to this HTTP route

<<<

== Get the user

The simplest way to retrieve the currently authenticated principal is via a static call to the SecurityContextHolder.

[source, java]
----
Authentication authentication = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
String currentPrincipalName = authentication.getName();
----

Alternatively, we can also use the AuthenticationPrincipal annonation

[source, java]
----
@Controller
public class SecurityController {

        @GetMapping(path = "/{id}")
    public String findUserName(@AuthenticationPrincipal UserDetails userDetails) {
        return userDetails.getUsername();
    }
}
----
<<<

== Check permission

You can configure your app to secure yours methods. For that, add annotation `EnableGlobalMethodSecurity`

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true)
public class FaircorpApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(FaircorpApplication.class, args);
    }

}
----

And you will be able to use @Secured. For example

[source, java]
----
@Secured("ROLE_ADMIN") // (1)
@GetMapping
public ResponseEntity<String> findAll(@AuthenticationPrincipal UserDetails userDetails) {
   return ResponseEntity.ok(userDetails.getUsername());
}
----

<1> Here we add a constraint on the user role and user must have the role ADMIN


<<<

== icon:flask[] : Personalize your configuration

- Implement a custom config to manage your users in your own `UserDetailsService`. You must have one classical user and one admin user
- Configure security to secure all the routes and to let only admin users see the /api routes
- Add a new REST endpoint to return the username. This endpoint must be only accessible to an admin user

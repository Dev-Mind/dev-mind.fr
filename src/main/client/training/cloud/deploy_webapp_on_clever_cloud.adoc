== Clever Cloud

Clever cloud is a platform designed by developers for developers.

You Write Code. They Run It.

When you write code, you push sources on Github. Clever Cloud is able to install your Github app

Sign in on https://github.com/ with your account. If you haven't an account you have to create one

When you are connected, you can create a new account on https://www.clever-cloud.com/en/

[.small]#ESME space will be added on your clever cloud environment#

Before this deployment you have to create a folder called "clevercloud" in your Spring Boot project

Inside, add a file `gradle.json`. This file will contain

[source,java]
----
{
  "build": {
    "type": "gradle",
    "goal": "assemble"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "jarName": "./build/libs/faircorp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
  }
}
----

To know the name of your jar go on folder `./build/libs/`

Push your change on a Github repository. If can create a new directory

We will create a new app on the Clever Cloud console in the ESME organization

You will create a new application. This application will be generated from a Github repository

You have to choose the kind of your application. For a Spring Boot application it will be a Java and Gradle application

The next step consist to choose the type of your server. You can keep the default configuration or click on the edit button.

You have several available configurations but more your server will be powerful more the price is expensive

You can use a specific name. It's important when you have several apps. In our case you have to use `faircorp-firstname-lastname`. For me for example the app should be called `faircorp-guillaume-ehret`

In the next step you can define environment variables. It's not very important in our example. You can click on the Next button

Installation starts and you have to wait several minutes.

You can explore different section to update your parameters

* Overview : contains buttons to reinstall your app and the link to access to your app
* Information
* Scalability
* Domain names : helps to personalize the URL of its application or parameter its own domain main
* Environment variables
* Service dependencies
* Exposed configuration
* Activity
* Logs
* Metrics

Define a custom URL to access to your application and click on the star to use it by default

Now you can use your app deployed on the Internet. This app will be automatically redeployed, when you will push a new commit on Github.

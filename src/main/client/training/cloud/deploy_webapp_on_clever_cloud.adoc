Before this deployment you have to create a folder called "*clevercloud*" in your Spring Boot project

Inside, add a file `gradle.json`.This file will contain

[source,java, subs="specialchars"]
----
{
  "build": {
    "type": "gradle",
    "goal": "assemble"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "jarName": "./build/libs/faircorp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
  }
}
----

To know the name of your jar go on folder `./build/libs/`.Push your last changes on your Github repository.Fot the moment, Clevercloud used only Github

You are ready to deploy your app in Clever Cloud.Open https://console.clever-cloud.com/organisations/orga_1e317288-9f24-486c-b843-6f7d6e311917[EMSE Clever Cloud space]

You have to use a specific name.It's important when you have several apps.In our case you have to use `*faircorp-firstname-lastname*`.You must also select in which zone of the world your application will be deployed (you can only select France in this lab).

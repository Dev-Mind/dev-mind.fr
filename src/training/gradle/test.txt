Using existing Gradle builds
Gradle supports many major IDEs, including Android Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio 2017, and XCode. You can also invoke Gradle via its command-line interface in your terminal or through your continuous integration server. Gradle build scans help you understand build results, improve build performance, and collaborate to fix problems faster.

Enterprise Services — Support and training can be purchased alongside a Gradle Enterprise subscription.

Why a build tool?
to compile your project but not only

to generate your delivery package (.war, .jar, …​) and deploy it!

to generate the doc

to run the tests

to generate the quality reports

…​

“My IDE can’t do this?”

“Only some of these tasks Dud! And a lot of manual configuration, without scripting, and not shareable”

Why automate?
Write once, run everywhere

Do not forget, not be mistaken

Continuous Integration

Deployment with confidence

During the whole lab, you’re going to practise Gradle and you would need the official doc, so open it : https://docs.gradle.org/4.2/userguide/introduction.html
What are the differences between Maven and Gradle
Maven brought good ideas :

plugins

convention over configuration

standard cycle standard

dependency management

But…​

XML ;-(

Verbose

Rigid

Bad documentation

Getting started - Fast!
Be sure of having a GitHub account!
Clone the GitHub Project : https://github.com/acrepet/killerapp.git

Check your local workspace, import the project into IDEA (File → New → Project From Existing Sources → Import Project from external model → Gradle)

importgradleproject
Your build.gradle (at root of your app) file should look like this and let you to configure the object Project

build.gradle
group 'emse'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

apply plugin: 'java'

sourceCompatibility = 1.8

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.12'
}
You can now open a new console and run the following command:

$ ./gradlew build

gradlew is the gradle wrapper (see below)

and try to build your project via IDEA → right click on build.gradle → Run Build

Wrapper
Problems :

Most tools require installation on your computer before you can use them. If the installation is easy, you may think that’s fine. But it can be an unnecessary burden on the users of the build.

Will the team members install the right version of the tool for the build? What if they’re building an old version of the software?

You have to fix a bug in a version of two years ago, which version of gradle is used for this old project

The Gradle Wrapper (henceforth referred to as the “Wrapper”) solves these problems and is the preferred way of starting a Gradle build.

Wrapper ?

a jar : ~50 KBs

a property file

a gradlew.bat file(Windows)

a gradlew file (Unix, MacOS)

These files are saved with all the sources (with Git of course!)

Gradle’s Anatomy
Projects

Tasks

Dependency Resolution

Lifecycle

Gradle Project
"build.gradle" configures the project

Project provides the base DSL (Domain Specific Language)

Build steps are performed by Tasks

Plugins provide preconfigured tasks

Task
Define what we have to do, perform an action

A lot of predefined and configurable tasks

A task could depend on another task or several tasks

Build LifeCycle
A Gradle build has three distinct phases :

Initialization During this phase, Gradle determines which projects are going to take part in the build (through build.gradle files). Gradle supports single and multi-project builds), and creates a Project instance for each of these projects.

Configuration During this phase Gradle parse the build file’s configuration (several files could be parsed). The project objects are configured. The build scripts of all projects which are part of the build are executed.

Execution Gradle executes the task graph → determines the subset of the tasks, created and configured during the configuration phase, to be executed. The subset is determined by the task name arguments passed to the gradle command and the current directory. Gradle then executes each of the selected tasks.

Dependencies between tasks
All the tasks create a DAG

DAG = Directed Acyclic Graph

Append these lines to your build.gradle file :

tasks dependencies
task hello {
    doLast {
        println 'Hello'
    }
}

task world(dependsOn: hello) {
    doLast {
        println 'World'
    }
}
Then, run :

$ ./gradlew hello
and :

$ ./gradlew world
Try to replace :

tasks dependencies
task world(dependsOn: hello) {
    doLast {
        println 'World'
    }
}
by these lines :

tasks dependencies
task world(dependsOn: hello) {
    println 'World'
}
Then, run :

$ ./gradlew world
Which tasks exist?
Clean and refator your build.gradle. Keep only these lines :

build.gradle
group 'emse'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'
Then, run :

$ ./gradlew tasks

> Task :tasks

Dependencies
If your build script needs to use external libraries, you can add them to the script’s classpath in the build script itself. You do this using the buildscript() method, passing in a closure which declares the build script classpath.

Example :

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone' }
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:2.0.0.M3'
    }
}
You can add dependencies and repositories in your build.gradle file :

dependencies {
    compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'
    compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    testCompile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
}
and try to run :

$ ./gradlew dependencies

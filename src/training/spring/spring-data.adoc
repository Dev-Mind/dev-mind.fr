How use a database in your Spring project with Spring Data JPA and a H2 Database? Hibernate will be the JPA implementation

image::../../img/training/spring-data.png[size=100%]


== Database
An application needs access to data, write data, update these data ...

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/app-data.png[size=100%]

Today we can access a multitude of data sources ... and Spring will help us

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/app-data2.png[size=100%]

How can we persist data  in Java?

1. a low level standard : *JDBC* (Java Database Connectivity)
2. an API, *JPA* (Java Persistence API) and frameworks as Hibernate
3. an API, *JTA* (Java Transaction API) to manage transactions

== JDBC

* common API used by all relational databases
* each DBMS editor (DataBase Management System) provides its driver (a jar added to your project)
* each DBMS accept SQL code to execute request and execute order on the database

In our tests we will use a database written in Java, the H2 database

[cols="1,3"]

* Open source, JDBC driver
* embedded database
* in memory database (perfect for tests)
* Browser based Console application
* Small footprint
|===

== Lab 3 : Database and SQL

Go in your FaircorpApplication. We need to use these Spring Boot starters

[source,groovy]
----
implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa')
implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web')
implementation('com.h2database:h2')
----

Check your `build.gradle` file

Spring Boot analyses jars defined in classpath and Spring auto-configures features as the database, the H2 console...

Add some properties in file `src/main/resources/application.properties`

[source,shell]
----
# Spring boot : datasource
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:faircorp;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
spring.datasource.platform=h2
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.sqlScriptEncoding=UTF-8

# Spring boot : H2 datasource
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/console
----

[.small .small-block]#We configure a in memory database#

You can use the H2 console. URL will be http://localhost:8080/console

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/h2-console0.png[width=50%]

[.small .small-block]#Use JDBC URL, user, password defined in your `application.properties`#

You should access to the console

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/h2-console.png[size=90%]

SQL order to create a table +
[.small .small-block]#Id is generated by the database (option auto_increment)#
[.small]
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE ROOM(ID BIGINT auto_increment PRIMARY KEY, NAME VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL);
----

SQL order to insert data in this table +
[.small .small-block]#We use a negative id because we don't use the ID generator in manual inserts#
[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO ROOM(ID, NAME) VALUES(-10, 'Room1');
----

SQL order to select this data
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM ROOM;
----

== Java and JDBC
Database connection in Java

[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
try {
  Class.forName("org.h2.Drive"); // <1>
}
catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
  logger.error("Unable to load JDBC Driver", e);
}
try {
  String database_url = "jdbc:h2:mem:bigcorp;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE" // <2>
  Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(database_url, username, password); // <3>
}
catch (SQLException e) {
  logger.error("Unable to connect to the database", e);
}
----

1. Load JDBC driver (here H2 driver)
2. We define the URL to access to the database (here we say that we use a H2 database in memory) +
3. Open a connection with username/password

But...

* this code is verbose, difficult to read
* a database connection is slow...
* ... we need to use a connection pool with preopened connections

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/pool.png[size=100%]

When you want to execute a request in Java you can write

*For an insert*
[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
public void insertSite(Site site) {
    try(Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection()){
        String sql = "insert into SITE (id, name) values (?, ?)";
        try(PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)){
          stmt.setString(1, site.getId());
          stmt.setString(2, site.getName());
          stmt.executeUpdate();
        }
    }
    catch(SQLException e) {
        throw new DatabaseException("Impossible to insert site " +
            site.getName(), e);
    }
}
----

*For a select*
[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
public List<Site> findAll() {
    List<Site> sites = new ArrayList<>();
    try(Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection()){
        String sql = "select id, name from SITE";
        try(PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)){
            try (ResultSet resultSet = stmt.executeQuery()) {
                while(resultSet.next()) {
                    Site s = new Site(resultSet.getString("name"));
                    s.setId(resultSet.getString("id"));
                    sites.add(s);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    catch(SQLException e) {
        throw new DatabaseException("Impossible to read sites", e);
    }
    return sites;
}
----


* Again the code is heavy and difficult to read
* We need to manipulate the data types in the SQL and in our entities
* We manipulate SQL while we are in an object language
* We would like to be more productive, simplified relationship management...
* What about transactions?

== Transaction

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/transaction1.png[width=100%]

* What happens if a query fails, or if an exception occurs?
* What happens if 2 transactions run in parallel?
* What happens if a request is too long?

The solution is to work in a transaction
[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
public void insertSite(Site site) {
        try(Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection()){
            conn.setAutoCommit(false); // <1>
            String sql = "insert into SITE (id, name) values (?, ?)";

            try(PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)){
                stmt.setString(1, site.getId());
                stmt.setString(2, "toto');drop table SITE CASCADE; Select ('1");
                stmt.executeUpdate();
                conn.commit(); // <2>
            }
            catch(SQLException e) {
                conn.rollback(); // <2>
                throw new DatabaseException("Impossible insérer site " + site.getName(), e);
            }
        }
        catch(SQLException e) {
            throw new DatabaseException("Impossible insérer site " + site.getName(), e);
        }
    }
----

[.small .small-block]#1. We disable autocommit +
2. If everything is OK a commit persit my changes +
3. If we have an error everything is cancelled#

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/transaction2.png[width=100%]


== JPA

With Persistence API/Framework, the approach is to :

* work with POJO => Plain Old Java Objects, Java entities
* add annotations to map entity properties to table columns
* generate common database request (Create, Update, Delete, Read)
* fill the SQL imperfections: inheritance, relationships, customs types, validation


Spring provides several sub projects to make database interactions easy

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/app-data3.png[size=100%]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Do not confuse https://projects.spring.io/spring-data/[Spring Data] with https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/[Spring Data JPA]. We can read on in the offical doc that "Spring Data’s mission is to provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store. It makes it easy to use data access technologies, relational and non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud-based data services. This is an umbrella project which contains many subprojects that are specific to a given database […​]

Spring Data JPA is part of Spring Data, lets implement JPA based repositories. It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies."
--

The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java application programming interface specification that describes the management of relational data in applications using Java Platform, Standard Edition and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition.

http://hibernate.org/orm/[Hibernate ORM] is the JPA implementation that we’re going to use in this lab.

We’re going to use https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/[Spring Data JPA] to store and retrieve data in our relational database.

----

* (1) indicates that this class is an entity managed by Hibernate
* (2) you can customize the table name (optional)
* (3) you have always an id annotated with `@javax.persistence.Id` (auto generated in this example). This ID is immutable (as the primary key in the database)
* (4) by default, each property is mapped to a column. You can customize the nullability or the column name.
* (5) If a property should not be persisted, use @Transient
* (6) Java enum persisted as a String
* (7) must have an empty constructor (public or protected). +
[.small .small-block]#An empty constructor is needed to create a new instance via reflection (using Class<T>.newInstance()) by Hibernate which has to instantiate your Entity dynamically. If you don’t provide any additional constructors with arguments for the class, you don’t need to provide an empty constructor because you get one per default. Java always gives you a default invisible empty constructor. If an argument constructor is provided in your class, then jvm will not add the no-argument constructor.#
* (8) you can add a constructor to build an object with all required properties
* (9) you have to define a getter and a setter for each property

== Entity manager

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/em.png[size=88%]

== Entity lifecycle

The entities managed by Hibernate have a life-cycle associated with them. Either you can create a new object and save it into the database or your can fetch the data from the database.

The Entities go through several stages in the life-cycle.

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/lifecycle.png[size=100%]

*Transient Objects* +
[.small .small-block]#Transient objects are non transactional and in fact Hibernate has no knowledge of these objects#

*Persistent Objects* +
[.small .small-block]#Persistent entity has a valid database identity associated with.#

*Removed Object* +
[.small .small-block]#An object scheduled for deletion either by calling delete or because of orphan deletion of entities.#

*Detached Object* +
[.small .small-block]#The object in persistent state go into detached state after the persistent context is closed. Detached objects can be brought into other persistent context by reattachment or merging. Detached object still has a valid primary key attribute but it is no longer managed by Hibernate.#

We have different operations to several stages in the life-cycle.

*persist()* +
[.small .small-block]#makes a persistent entity. It will be written in the database at the next commit of the transaction we are in..#

*remove()* +
[.small .small-block]#inverse of persist(). It will be erased from the database at the next commit of the transaction we are in.#

*refresh()* +
[.small .small-block]#synchronizes the state of an entity to its database state. If the fields of an entity have been updated in the current transaction, these changes will be canceled. This operation only applies to persistent entities (otherwise we have an IllegalArgumentException)#

*detach()* +
[.small .small-block]#detaches an entity from  entity manager. This entity will not be taken into account during the next commit of the transaction in which we are#

*merge()* +
[.small .small-block]#attach an entity to the current entity manager. This is used to associate an entity with another entity manager than the one that was used to create or read it.#


== Transaction and Spring

We must work in transactions to ensure data integrity.

Transactional policy is managed by Spring with @Transactional annotation. For example

[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
@Service
@Transactional
public class SiteServiceImpl implements SiteService {

    public Site addSite(String name){
        Site site = new Site(name);
        site.addSensor(new Sensor("default", site)
                               .withPowerSource(PowerSource.FIXED)
                               .withDefaultPowerInWatt(1_000_000));
        siteDao.save(site);
        return site;
    }
}
----

Your services, your components must use a *@Transactional*

Hibernate stores everything read from the database in a first-level cache. This cache is linked to the current transaction. +
[.small .small-block]#If you do twice a find() on the same instance, it will only be loaded once#

At the end of the transaction, Hibernate will launch a flush() of this cache

* Calculation of the modifications of the objects contained in this cache
* Execution of all requests as a result
* Launching commit() if everything is OK or rollback()

== Association mappings

Association mappings are one of the key features of JPA and Hibernate. They define the relationship between the database tables and the attributes in your Entity.

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/relation.png[size=100%]

A relationship between JPA entities. can be unidirectional or bidirectional. In this second case, one of the two entities must be master and the other slave.

It defines in which direction you can use the relationship.


== @OneToOne

Example of *unidirectional relation*: a city has a mayor but the mayor does not know his city

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/relation1to1.png[]

A column mayor_id will be added in the table and a foreign key will be created


[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Mayor {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    //...
}


@Entity
public class Town {
     @Id
     private Long id;
     private String name;
     @OneToOne
     private Mayor mayor;

     // ...
}
----

Example of *bidirectional* relationship: a city has a mayor and the mayor now knows his city

A column mayor_id will be added in the `Town` table and a foreign key will be created but we have no town_id in the `Mayor` table (Master is town)

[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Mayor {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    //...
}


@Entity
public class Town {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy="mayor")
    private Mayor mayor;

    // Reste du code
}
----

`mappedBy` indicates that the `Town` table will be the master and will bring the relationship to the database.

== @OneToMany

Example of *unidirectional* relation: a site has one or more sensors (sensor does not link to a site)

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/relation1ton.png[]

A join table is added (with 2 foreign keys)

[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Sensor {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

     // ...
}


@Entity()
public class Site {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @OneToMany
    private Set<Sensor> sensors;

    // ...
}
----


== @ManyToOne

Example of *unidirectional* relation: a measurement is linked to a sensor and the sensor does not have the list of measurements

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/relationnto1.png[]

A sensor_id column will be added to the Measure table and a foreign key will be created

[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Sensor {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    // ...
}

@Entity
public class Measure {

    @Id
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne(optional = false)
    private Sensor sensor;

    // ...
}
----


== @OneToMany @ManyToOne


Example of *bidirectional* relation: a site has n sensors and sensor knows his site

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/relation1ton2.png[]

Only the @OneToMany annotation has a `mappedBy` property (which is used to designate the master)

[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
// Slave
@Entity
public class Sensor {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

     // ...
}

// Master
@Entity()
public class Site {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "site")
    private Set<Sensor> sensors;

    // ...
}
----

== @ManyToMany

Exemple relation *unidirectionnelle* : a musician plays several instruments (instrument does not know who uses it)

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/relationnton.png[]

A join table is added (with 2 foreign keys)

[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Instrument {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

     // ...
}


@Entity()
public class Musician {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @ManyToMany
    private Set<Instrument> instruments;

    // ...
}
----

Example *bidirectional* relation : a musician plays several instruments (instrument knows that they play musicians)

A join table is always present (with 2 foreign keys) but we must define who is master

[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Instrument {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy="instruments")
    private Set<Musician> musicians;
     // ...
}


@Entity()
public class Musician {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @ManyToMany
    private Set<Instrument> instruments;

    // ...
}
----


== Data Access Object (DAO)

A DAO (Data Access Object) lets you persist your Entities.

The DAO is basically an object or an interface that provides access to an underlying database or any other persistence storage.

That definition from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object[Wikipedia]

An example of Spring Data Jpa repository
[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
public interface SensorDao extends JpaRepository<Sensor, Long> {
}
----

This extends a Spring Data interface, which provides common methods such as findOne, save and more. This repository will handle Sensors entities, and those are identified by an Id of type Long

[.small .small-block]#If you want to create your own methods, you have to create a new interface#
[.langage-verysmall]
[source,java]
----
public interface SensorCustomDao {
    List<Sensor> findBySiteId(String siteId);
}
----

[.small .small-block]#You need to update the main interface#
[.langage-verysmall]
[source,java]
----
public interface SensorDao extends JpaRepository<Sensor, String>, SensorCustomDao {
}
----

[.small .small-block]#And now you can implement your `SensorCustomDao` and use entitiy manager to execute requests#

[.langage-verysmall]
[source,java]
----
@Repository
public class SensorCustomDaoImpl implements SensorCustomDao {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager em;

    @Override
    public List<Sensor> findBySiteId(String siteId) {
        return em.createQuery("select c from Sensor c inner join c.site s where s.id = :siteId",
                              Sensor.class)
                 .setParameter("siteId", siteId)
                 .getResultList();
    }
}
----

== JPQL

With JPA we don't write SQL but JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language). We don't use the column names but we use the JPA entities

In SQL we select a list of columns belonging to one or more tables. In JPQL we select an entity.

[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
// Selection sensors
select c from Sensor c

// Selection sites linked to a sensor
select c.site from Sensor c
----

You can use implicit join
[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
select c from Sensor c where c.site.id = :siteId
----

Or you can use explicit join
[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
select c from Sensor c join c.site s where s.id = :siteId
select c from Sensor c left join c.site s where s.id = :siteId
----

== Spring Data JPA

With Spring Data Jpa, if you respect conventions you don't need to create a DAO implementation

[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
public interface SensorDao extends JpaRepository<Sensor, String>, SensorCustomDao {

    List<Sensor> findBySiteId(String siteId); // <1>

    @Query("select c from Sensor c where c.name=:name")  // <2>
    Sensor findByName(@Param("name") String name);

    @Modifying
    @Query("delete from Sensor c where c.name = ?1")
    void deleteByName(String name);
}
----

1.  findBy pattern allows to execute a query and return an occurrence or an occurrence list
2. @Query helps to execute a JPQL query. Here we use a named parameter
3. Another example with an update. In this case, you must use an @Modifying annotation


A request starts by `findBy`, `findDistinctBy`, `countBy`, ...

You can after add a property
[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
List<Sensor> findByName(String name);
----

You can add a property of a property
[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
List<Sensor> findBySiteId(String siteId);
----

You can cumulate criteria
[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
List<Sensor> findByNameAndSiteId(String name, String siteId);
List<Sensor> findByNameOrSiteId(String name, String siteId);
----


You can ignore upper or lower case
[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
List<Sensor> findByNameIgnoreCase(String name);
List<Sensor> findByNameAndSiteIdAllIgnoreCase(String name, String siteId);
----

You can sort data
[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
List<Sensor> findByNameOrderByNameAsc(String name);
List<Sensor> findByNameOrderByNameDesc(String name);
----

Vous can select only one element (if you have for example an unicity constraint). But in this case if several elements are found an exception is thrown
[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
Sensor findByName(String name);
----

You can read link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/2.0.9.RELEASE/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods.details[the documentation] to know more things

== Fetching Strategy

Allows you to specify the loading strategy.

* LAZY [.small .small-block]#the value is loaded only when it is used  (default)#
* EAGER [.small .small-block]#the value is always loaded#

[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
private Set<Sensor> sensors;
----

By default we are in Lazy because the goal is to load the minimum of things

If you navigate in your object and if relations are set in Lazy mode, you have 2 cases

* You are attached to a persistence contex [.small .small-block]#one or more queries are started to load the missing data#
* You are not attached to a persistence contex [.small .small-block]#a LazyInitializationException is launched#

[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy
----

If you have to serialize your object or send it to another layer, you have to use DTO. We will see that later

== Lab 4 : JPA

It's time for you to start to build your real application which is able to manage sensors in a building like a light

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/tp.png[size=80%]

Create a Java enum called Status in package `com.esme.spring.faircorp.model`

This enum has 2 values : ON and OFF

Create a Light Entity class in package `com.esme.spring.faircorp.model`. You have to use the JPA annotations

[.langage-small]
[source,java]
----
// <1>
public class Light {

  // <2>
  private Long id;

  // <3>
  private Integer level;

  // <4>
  private Status status;

  public Light() {
  }

  public Light(Integer level, Status status) {
      this.level = level;
      this.status = status;
  }

  public Long getId() {
    return this.id;
  }

  public void setId(Long id) {
    this.id = id;
  }

  public Integer getLevel() {
     return level;
  }

  public void setLevel(Integer level) {
     this.level = level;
  }

  public Status getStatus() {
     return status;
  }

  public void setStatus(Status status) {
     this.status = status;
  }
}
----

Use the good annotations to

[.small]
1. Mark this class as a JPA entity
2. Declare this field as the table ID. This ID must to be auto generated
3. This field must be not nullable
4. status is also not nullable, and this field is an enumeration. You have to add this information

Write now the Room Entity. This entity should have

* an auto generated id
* a non nullable name
* an non nullable integer to indicate the floor
* a list of lights. You have to define a bidirectional relation between Room and Light (update the Ligth constructor to always send the light room when a room is created
* create a constructor with non nullable fields

Write now 2 DAO LightDao and RoomDao. We will use them in our code to load data

Update the file `application.properties` and add this keys

[.small]
[source,java]
----
# Spring boot : JPA
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect // <1>
spring.jpa.ddl-auto=create-drop // <2>
spring.jpa.show_sql=true // <3>
----
1. gives information to Hibernate for native SQL
2. allows you to auto generate the schema (tables, constraints) from your Java data model (none if you do not want to do anything)
3. displays queries in the logs (usefull in development)

Try to launch your application
If everything is OK you should use the H2 console and see your tables Ligth and Room

We're going to populate our database and insert data in tables

Create a file `data.sql` in src/main/resources next to `application.properties`

[.small]
[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO ROOM(ID, NAME, FLOOR) VALUES(-10, 'Room1', 1);
INSERT INTO ROOM(ID, NAME, FLOOR) VALUES(-9, 'Room2', 1);

INSERT INTO LIGHT(ID, LEVEL, STATUS, ROOM_ID) VALUES (-1, 8, 'ON', -10);
INSERT INTO LIGHT(ID, LEVEL, STATUS, ROOM_ID) VALUES (-2, 0, 'OFF', -10);
----

You're going to write your own DAO methods (for specific requests), you have to create custom interfaces and implementations with your custom methods.

Create your own interface LightDaoCustom

[source,java]
----
public interface LightDaoCustom {
    List<Light> findOnLights();
}
----

Refactor your LightDAO interface : it has to extend LightDaoCustom

Create your own implementation of LightDao with your custom methods and inject the EntityManager (JPA)

[source,java]
----
public class LightDaoImpl implements LightDaoCustom {
    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager em;

    @Override
    public List<Light> findOnLights() {
        String jpql = "select lt from Light lt where lt.status = :value";
        return em.createQuery(jpql, Light.class)
                 .setParameter("value", Status.ON)
                 .getResultList();
    }
}
----

You have to test your DAO. When Spring context is loaded, the database is populated with the file `data.sql` and we can test these values

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@DataJpaTest
@ComponentScan
public class LightDaoImplTest {

    @Autowired
    LightDao lightDao;

    @Test
    public void shouldFindOnLights() {
        assertThat(lightDao.findOnLights())
                .hasSize(1)
                .extracting("id", "status")
                .containsExactly(tuple(-1L, Status.ON));
    }
}
----

You have to test and develop :

* a custom DAO linked to room with a method to find a room by name
* a new method to find the room light when we send the id of the room
* you have to develop these methods and their tests
* you can now add a new Entity Building (a building has a set of rooms). This relation is bidirectional
* Adds a new DAO BuildingDAO and add a new method to find all the building ligths. You send a building ID and your method should return the list of the lights
* Adds a unit test to check that everything is OK

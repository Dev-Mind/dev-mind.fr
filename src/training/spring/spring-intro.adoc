== Introduction

=== Requirements

To be able to learn Spring you must have

* some basics in Java and JEE
* know unit testing in Java
* have knowledge of the Web
* know about JDBC and Hibernate
* a PC with a good IDE (IntelliJ, Netbeans ...)

=== What's Spring ?

Spring is the most used Java framework

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/historique.png[canvas, size=90%]

A framework comes with rules to organize developments

[%step]
* Good practices
* Abstraction of the complexity
* Provides utility classes
* Helps to focus on the business code and not on the technical plumbing

Spring is

[% Step]
* a Java framework
* an entire ecosystem
* a community
* a company

=== Spring framework

Make Java development easier

* Spring Core provides a framework to simplify project technical aspects
* Sub-projects deal with more specific technical issues
* Nothing is mandatory, everything is configurable
* Big effort on backward compatibility
* Spring Frmaework 5.0 and JDK> 1.8

=== An entire ecosystem

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/spring-projects.png[canvas, width=70%]

* Spring Batch
* Spring Mobile
* Spring LDAP
* Spring Social
* Spring web services
* ...

=== Open source project

[%step]
* Spring is an Open Source project
* ... but managed by a company  Pivotal
* Licence «Apache 2.0»
* https://github.com/spring-projects

=== Documentation

* Spring Core
[.small]#https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/#

== Start a project

=== Generate
To start, you can (you should) use the official generator https://start.spring.io/

image:../../img/training/spring-intro/springboot-init.png[size=90%]

Use these settings

* *generation* : from Gradle
* *Spring version* :  the highest (not suffixed snapshot or Mx)
* *group*: com.esme.spring +
* *artifact*: faircorp +
* *dependencies*: Web, JPA, DevTools

Click on the Generate button

=== Import in your IDE

1. Unzip the project into a directory (you can put it next to the first project we did in the TPs)
2. Open the project in an IDE

=== Gradle configuration

`settings.gradle`
[source,groovy]
----
rootProject.name = 'faircorp'
----

* contains the project name
* can also contain the sub modules definition +
[.small .small-block]#avec `include 'backend', 'frontend'`#

`build.gradle` (1/3)
[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
 ext {
  springBootVersion = '2.0.4.RELEASE' // <1>
 }
 repositories {
  	mavenCentral() // <2>
 }
 dependencies { // <3>
  classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:${springBootVersion}")
 }
}
----

[.small]#<1> Spring version +
<2> Plugin repository +
<3> Adds the springBoot plugin#

`build.gradle` (2/3)
[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'java' // <1>
apply plugin: 'org.springframework.boot'
apply plugin: 'io.spring.dependency-management'

group = 'com.training.spring' // <2>
version = '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'
sourceCompatibility = 1.8

repositories { // <3>
 mavenCentral()
}
----

[.small]#<1> Used plugins : boot to manage your application, dependency-management for the dépendances +
<2> Project id +
<3> Libraries repository#

`build.gradle` (3/3)
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies { // <1>
 compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web') // <2>
 testCompile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test') // <3>
}
----

[.small .small-block]#1.{nbsp} Declaration of dependencies used for compilation, execution or testing (for dependencies managed by Spring you don't need to specify the version number. `io.spring.dependency-management` plugin) was here for that +
{nbsp} +
2. `spring-boot-starter-web` is a starter used to create WebApp +
{nbsp} +
3. `spring-boot-starter-test` is the starter that imports dependencies used in the tests (SpringTest, Junit, Mockito ...)#

=== FaircorpApplication

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class FaircorpApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(FaircorpApplication.class, args);
	}
}
----

* `@SpringBootApplication` initialize a Spring Boot application. This is the main class

=== FaircorpApplicationTests

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class) // <1>
@SpringBootTest // <2>
public class FaircorpApplicationTests {

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() {
	}

}
----
<1> Runner to use when w ewant to test a Spring class
<2> Annotation which creates an application context dedicated for tests

=== application.properties

* This file is in `src/main/resources`, it contains all the application properties +
[.small .small-block]#> A property has a key and a value. In your code you read a property by its key. At runtime you have the value +
> Properties help to customize app on a particular environment+
{nbsp}#
* If you have an `application-prod.properties` file, it will be into account only when the `prod`  profile will be activated

=== Launch application

[source,shell,linenums,subs=""]
----
./gradlew --continuous bootRun // <1>

[...]
INFO 9740 --- [  restartedMain] s.b.c.e.t.TomcatEmbeddedServletContainer : Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)
INFO 9740 --- [  restartedMain] f.i.tc.s.SpringBootIntroApplication : Started SpringBootIntroApplication in 2.971 seconds
<==========---> 80% EXECUTING
> :bootRun  // <2>
----

* [.small .small-block]#the --continuous gradle option will restart the server when we recompile the project#
* the build gets "stuck" at 80%, but the server is actually started and ready to accept connections
* To stop the application use kbd: [Ctrl + c]

== Application packaging

Gradle helps to generate a web archive and it can deploy this archive on an application server

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/mvc-deploy.png[size=80%]

This is the past... now

With Spring Boot, an app should be autonomous, this is the convention.

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/mvc-run.png[size=80%]


[source,shell]
----
./gradlew assemble
----

* This task generate a jar (Java archive) in `build/libs`.
* jar name is `faircorp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`. It contains everything you need to launch the application (conf + libs)
* To launch your Spring Boot App you can execute

[source,shell]
----
java -jar build/libs/faircorp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

== Lab 1 : generate a new app
The aim is to build a Spring Boot application called FairCorp

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/faircorp.svg[size=80%]

* Use the Spring generator
* Import the app in IntelliJ
* Use the different ways to launch app (gradlew, java -jar, IDE)
* Open URL localhost:8080 in your browser +
[.small]#You should see a message "Whitelabel Error Page", Don’t panic : since we’ve defined no web endpoint, Spring answers with a custom HTTP 404 error message…​ We’re going to understand what happened#
* Launch tests in your IDE
* Create a new file in `src/main/resources/static`. The name will be `index.html`
* In this file copy the following code

[source,html,linenums,subs=""]
----
<html>
    <head>
        <title> Spring in practice</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Hello world
    </body>
</html>
----

* Recompile your code or restart your app
* Reopen localhost:8080 in your browser

== Next labs

During all your courses (Java, Spring, Web, IOT, Security...) you will develop a real app on a concrete case

image::../../img/training/spring-intro/tp.png[size=80%]

In this app, you will manage ligths of a building. You have several rooms by floor and each room can have one or several lights.

For each room we want to know the lights and their steps (off or on). If a lamp is on, we want to have the brightness. We want to pilot each lights from this app.

In the next chapters we will do that

== Understand what's happened

In few lines you have started your first Spring project. I spoke about Spring, Spring Framework, Spring Boot... But what's the difference ?

**Spring Framework **

is a popular, open-source, Java-based application framework - we saw before that we have many other projects for big data, storing data, securing applications, and more!

Spring based applications have a lot of configuration.


*Spring Boot*

takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries.

With Spring Boot, it’s easy to create applications for all types of workloads. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

Spring Boot is a "convention over configuration" type of framework, with no code generation.

[.small]#When we use Spring MVC (the original web framework built on the Servlet API) for example, we need to configure for example the dispatcher servlet among other things. +
When we use the Spring support of Hibernate/JPA, we would need to configure a datasource, an entity manager factory, a transaction manager…​#

Spring Boot simplifies all of these configuration elements, by auto-configuration. [.small]#For example, when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath, Spring Boot adds automatically @EnableWebMvc on your context.#

With Spring boot we will use starters

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
 compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web')
 testCompile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test')
}
----

The starter name starts by *spring-boot-starter-XXXX* and use a suffix XXXX (web, cache, data-jpa, mustache, web...)

In the next course we will see how to add objects to our app and how we can linked them each other...
